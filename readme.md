# framer-electron-preview

**Quickly run Framer.js prototypes within Electron.**

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) is a framework that allows developers to build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Since Framer.js is ultimately just javascript, running it inside of Electron is a simple way to preview your desktop prototype in a fully native context (i.e. outside of Framer Studio, in a native desktop window).

## Install
From your command line:
```bash
# Install the cli globally on your computer
npm i -g framer-electron-preview
```

## To Use
From your command line:
```bash
# Open your (existing) Framer.js prototype folder
cd MyPrototype.framer

# Run your prototype inside of an Electron shell 
fep
```
