### WIP

**Convert your Framerjs prototypes into Electron apps for Windows or Mac.**

Based on [Framer Electron Preview](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/framer-electron-preview/) by Jared Palmer.

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) is a framework that allows developers to build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Since Framer.js is ultimately just javascript, running it inside of Electron is a simple way to preview your desktop prototype in a fully native context (i.e. outside of Framer Studio, in a native desktop window).

## Getting Started
From your command line:
```bash
# Install the cli globally on your computer
npm i -g framer-electron-preview

# Open your (existing) Framer.js prototype folder and run `fep`
cd MyPrototype.framer && fep
```
