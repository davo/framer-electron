# framer-electron-preview (a.k.a 'fep')

**Quickly run Framer.js prototypes within Electron.**

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) is a framework that allows developers to build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Since Framer.js is ultimately just javascript, running it inside of Electron is a simple way run your desktop prototype in a native context (i.e. outside of Framer Studio, in a native desktop window).

## How to use
```bash
# to install globally on your computer...
npm i -g framer-electron-preview

# Open your Framer.js prototype in terminal...
cd MyPrototype.framer

# Now run your prototype inside of an Electron shell 
fep
```
